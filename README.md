# Facial Image Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains a modular pipeline for facial image preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification, along with tools for visualizing appearance features and generating average facial representations.

## üß© Main Pipeline Description

```plaintext
BEGIN FacialImageAnalysisPipeline

IMPORT MachineLearningLibrary

// Step 1: Initialize folder structure and preprocess images
FUNCTION Initialize():
    createOutputFolderStrucure() // Create required folders
    rescaleImagesAlignLandmarks(): // Rescales and aligns all images in the dataset
    FOR each image IN dataset:
        Convert RGB image to grayscale image
        normalizeImageAndLandmarks() // Generalized Procrustes Analysis for single image. Output is aligned and cropped face region with 150x150 resolution
        SaveLocalBinaryPatterns() // Calculate and save the local binary patterns

// Step 2: Compute features and prepare for cross-validation
FUNCTION CalculateFeaturesForCrossValidation():
    CalculateLDAMatrices_CrossValidation() // Create matrices used to calculate the appearance features from local binary patterns 
    FOR each image IN dataset:
        GetFeatures() // Calculate all features including the appearance and geometric features

// Step 3: Perform leave-one-out cross-validation using the calculated features
FUNCTION CrossValidate():
    Perform Mann Whitney U test for all the features
    For k FROM 1 TO maximum number of features to select:
        Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance
        Use Recursive Feature Elimination with a linear SVM model to select k features
        Perform leave-one-out cross-validation using the selected k features

// Step 4: Export the results to an Excel file
FUNCTION ExportCrossValidationToExcel()

// Main pipeline
CALL Initialize()
CALL CalculateFeaturesForCrossValidation()
CALL CrossValidate()
CALL ExportCrossValidationToExcel()

END
```

## üß™ Other Functions

**Appearance Feature Visualization**  
- `ExportTextureFeatures.py`: Plots the area around a particular landmark used in the local binary pattern calculation at a specific resolution.

**Average Face Generation**  
- `CreateStandardizedImages.py`: Generates standardized face images by registering to a reference using landmarks and cropping the face region. Optional background removal.  
- `AverageFace.py`: Constructs an average face from the standardized dataset.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

### üìå Operating System
- **Tested on:** Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS (64-bit)
- **Other supported OS:** Any Linux-based system; macOS support possible with minor adjustments.
- **Windows support:** Not officially tested; may require `pathlib` and `OpenCV` compatibility fixes.

### üíª Programming Language
- **Language:** Python 3.6.9
- **Environment suggestion:** Use a virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`) to isolate dependencies.

### üì¶ Software Dependencies

The following Python packages are required:

| Package            | Version (suggested) | Notes                            |
|--------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|

| `scikit-learn`     | ‚â• 0.22              | LDA, cross-validation, SVM       |
| `scipy`            | ‚â• 1.4               | Statistical tests (Mann-Whitney) |
| `pandas`           | ‚â• 1.0               | Exporting results to Excel       |
| `openpyxl`         | ‚â• 3.0               | Excel writing support            |
| `matplotlib`       | (optional)          | For visual debugging/plots       |

### üìÅ Folder Expectations

Your pipeline assumes:
- Input image folders with consistent naming.
- Output folders for storing LBP features, aligned images, and Excel results.
- Modify paths in `FacialImageAnalysisPipeline.py` if running on a different directory structure.

---

### ‚úÖ Final Check

After setup, run:

```bash
python FacialImageAnalysisPipeline.py
```

To verify everything is installed correctly and the pipeline works end-to-end.
